# VSnx_OS
This is NON-POSIX x86_64/AMD64 independent OS. This OS is from complete scratch. this is just a hobby OS and very simple and lightweight and will have very reasonable real hardware compatiblity. Yet still in very early dev. and may take a while. Also thanks from this Github Repository: https://github.com/hairymnstr/gristle. Also the license is here for this: repo code: must be viewed in the license.md.
